# Intuition Farcaster Frame

The **Intuition Farcaster Frame** enables users to interact with the Intuition knowledge graph directly from the Farcaster protocol. With this frame, you can easily deposit on specific Atoms or Triples, allowing you to contribute knowledge and insights directly from within Farcaster.

## What is the Intuition Farcaster Frame?

The Intuition Farcaster Frame is a tool that bridges the Intuition knowledge graph and the Farcaster protocol, enabling seamless interaction. Users can:
- **Deposit on Atoms or Triples**: Contribute directly to individual Atoms (units of knowledge) or Triples (connections between knowledge) within the Intuition graph.
- **Enhance the Knowledge Graph**: By depositing on Atoms or Triples, you can add to the community’s shared insights and enhance the value of information accessible within Intuition.
- **Use Farcaster as an Access Point**: Access and engage with Intuition’s decentralized knowledge system without leaving the Farcaster platform.

## Installation

To set up the Intuition Farcaster Frame locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install required dependencies using `pnpm`:
     ```shell
     pnpm i
     ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Start the frame’s development server:
     ```shell
     pnpm dev
     ```

3. **Access the Frame**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173/dev](http://localhost:5173/dev) to view the frame in development mode.

4. **Interact with an Atom or Triple**:
   - To interact with a specific Atom or Triple, enter the following URL format in your browser:
     ```
     http://localhost:5173/frame/a/13
     ```
   - Replace `13` with the ID of the Atom or Triple you wish to interact with.

## Usage

Once set up, the Intuition Farcaster Frame allows you to deposit directly on Atoms or Triples:
- **Depositing on an Atom**: Access the frame via the specified URL structure to view and deposit on a specific Atom.
- **Contributing to Triples**: Similarly, the frame allows direct interaction with Triples, enabling you to strengthen connections within the knowledge graph by depositing your insights and resources.

This integration helps expand the Intuition knowledge graph through active engagement on Farcaster, making it easier for users to support and validate shared knowledge.
